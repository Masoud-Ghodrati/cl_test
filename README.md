# Unit sale prediction 

The aim is to predict the unit sales for different items sold at different stores over a time period. The main data was provided in a Kaggle competition [Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data) 

The training data includes dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting/data) for more information).
